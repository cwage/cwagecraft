# Flat Bedrock Mod

This modpack includes the **Flat Bedrock** mod to improve the EnderIO progression experience.

## What it does

- Generates flat bedrock layers at Y-level -64 in the Overworld
- Replaces vanilla's irregular bedrock formation with a consistent flat surface
- Does NOT affect Nether bedrock patterns (preserves Nether mechanics)

## Why it's included

**EnderIO Grains of Infinity** are a crucial crafting component but require interaction with bedrock:

- **Vanilla Problem**: Irregular bedrock makes finding good spots unpredictable
- **Solution**: Flat bedrock provides consistent, reliable access for farming Grains of Infinity
- **Result**: Smoother early-to-mid game progression into EnderIO's advanced automation systems

## Compatibility

- ✅ Compatible with Biomes O' Plenty and other worldgen mods
- ✅ Works with existing worlds (new chunks only)
- ✅ Does not break existing automation setups

## Technical Details

- **Mod**: Flat Bedrock (Forge / Fabric)
- **CurseForge**: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/flat-bedrock
- **Minecraft Version**: 1.20.1
- **Modloader**: Forge

## Gameplay Impact

### Positive
- Eliminates frustrating RNG from core automation component
