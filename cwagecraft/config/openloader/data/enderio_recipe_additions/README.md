# EnderIO Recipe Additions

This datapack adds missing recipes to EnderIO machines to provide better integration with other mods in the pack.

## Problem
EnderIO machines (SAG Mill and Alloy Smelter) were missing many common processing recipes that other mod machines could handle, creating gaps in automation and forcing players to use multiple machine types for basic operations.

## Solution
Adds comprehensive recipe support to EnderIO machines:

### SAG Mill Additions
- Grinding recipes for metal ingots from various mods (Mekanism, Thermal Foundation, Immersive Engineering, etc.)
- Consistent with other mod grinding machines like Thermal Pulverizers

### Alloy Smelter Additions  
- Basic smelting recipes that work in vanilla furnaces
- Ensures recipe parity for common materials and processing tasks

## Technical Details
