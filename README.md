## Installation

1. Download the `.mrpack` file from releases
2. Import into Prism Launcher, MultiMC, or similar launcher
3. Launch and enjoy!

## Development / Building

- Source of truth: run `./setup.sh` to build/export the pack. Do not use `packwiz add/remove` directly.
- Mods list lives in `mods.yaml`. By default, running `./setup.sh` will:
  - Ensure each mod listed in `mods.yaml` is present.
  - Keep existing, pinned versions (no automatic upgrades).
- To upgrade all mods to latest tracked versions, run: `./setup.sh --upgrade`.
- To bootstrap `mods.yaml` from the current pack state, run: `./setup.sh --export-mods`.

Pinning behavior: versions are effectively pinned by the generated `cwagecraft/mods/*.pw.toml` files. The `--upgrade` flag will re-resolve versions and update those pins.

## Custom Configurations

### Tinkers' Construct Early Levelling
This modpack includes a custom datapack that provides an early-game recipe for making tools improvable:
- **Recipe**: 5 Flint + Tinker Anvil â†’ Improvable modifier
- **Purpose**: Allows tool levelling progression without requiring expensive materials
- **Location**: `config/openloader/data/tla_early_leveling/`

## Attribution

- **Complementary Unbound Shaders**: Created by Complementary Development (https://www.complementary.dev/shaders/)
- **Tinkers' Construct Slime Island Configuration**: Modified generation frequency via datapack
